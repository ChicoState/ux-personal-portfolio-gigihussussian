# UX Portfolio 

About me... My name Gigi Hussussian! I have a major in communications of sciences and disorders and a minor in child development. I am on the expressions dance team for my 3rd year here. In my free time I love the beach and going bowling or going to any live music. I babysit in my hometown and work at a dance studio as well, I love kids and dance! I have taken one engineering writing class before but I believe this will be different experience, I am excited to try something new.
