My experience with the gym doors located at the WREC has made me notice all Norman Doors that I have ever or become encountered with. These doors are explained best by Don Norman, who coined the reference due to the poorly designed doors manufactured that confuse people. The main problem, the affordances do not match the action required, contributing to confusion of pushing or pulling. 
My own person experience battling the Norman Door starts with the WREC's studio doors. I use these doors every other day for practice and I still happen to pull or push incorrectly. So, I walk up the stairs and as I approached the entrance of the dance studio, I encountered a familiar obstacle, the Norman Door. Standing before me was the sleek, modern door, the two handles close together offering no hints on how to proceed. 

Goal: My goal was simple, to enter the studio uninterrupted with only one push or pull, ready to enter into the studio and dance without any unnecessary delays or confusion.

Description of Interaction: With a mixture of excitement and curiosity, I reached for the door handle, hoping for a smooth entry. However, the handle offered no clues as to whether I should push or pull. I hesitated for a moment before instinctively pulling on the handle, expecting the door to yield to my touch. Yet, it remained stubbornly shut, denying my efforts. Frustration crept in as I glanced around for guidance. I look up to see the hinges, but I do not understand door hinges because I am not an engineer. Gathering my resolve, I pushed against the door, and with a soft click, it swung open, welcoming me into the studio. 

Outcome: Despite the initial confusion and minor hiccup, I finally made my way into the studio, eager to begin the dance class. However, the encounter with the Norman door left a lingering sense of frustration, momentarily disrupting the excitement of the moment.

Assessment: This encounter shed light on the importance of **affordance** in design, particularly in environments like dance studios where users seek **effective** and **efficient** experiences that complement their movements with fluidity and grace. The lack of clear **feedback** through the door handle led to user confusion and a slight delay in entry, disrupting the dancers' mental model of a seamless transition into the studio space. To enhance the user experience, the studio could consider redesigning the door with more **effective** handles or incorporating a sign to indicate the correct method of opening. By aligning the door's design with user expectations, the studio can ensure a smoother entry process for studio goers, allowing them and myself to focus on our craft without unnecessary distractions.
